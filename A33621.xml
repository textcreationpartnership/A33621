            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Tenant at will ſhall reap the crop which he ſowed in peace,
albeit the leſſor doth determine his will before it bee ripe; for that the
eſtate of the leſſee is uncertain, and it is good for the Commonwealth
that the ground be ſown. And this is not onely proper to a leſſee at
will; but to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tenant that hath an eſtate incertain. And
therefore if tenant for life ſoweth the ground, and dyeth, his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſhall have the Corn. And the ſame law is for leſſee for yeares of
tenant for life. So if a man be ſeiſed of land in the right of his wife,
&amp;c. his executor ſhall have the Corn. But if husband and wife bee
joynt-tenants of the land, and the husband ſoweth the ground, and the land
ſurviveth to the wife, it is ſaid that ſhe ſhall have the Corn,
<hi>Dier</hi> 316.</p>
               <p>But where the eſtate of the leſſee being incertain, is
defeaſible by a right Paramount, or if the leaſe determine by the act of
the leſſee, as by Forfeiture, Condition, &amp;c There he that hath the
right Paramount, or that entreth for any forfeiture, &amp;c. ſhall have the
Corn. <hi>fol.</hi> 55. <hi>b. l.</hi> 5 106</p>
               <p>If a diſſeiſſor ſow the ground and ſever the Corn,
and the diſſeiſſee re-enter, he ſhall have the Corn, becauſe he
entreth by a former title, and ſeverance or removing of the 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33382:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> Corn altereth not the caſe; for the regreſſe
is a continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Freehold in him in judgment of law from the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>If the husband and wife make a leaſe at will of the wifes
land, reſerving a rent, and the husband dye, yet the leaſe continueth. So
if a leaſe be made by two to two others at will, and the one of the
leſſors or of the leſſees dye, the leaſe at will is not determined,

                  <p>By this Section it appeareth, that when in a general grant,
the Law doth give two remedies, that the grantor may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that the grantee
ſhall not uſe one of them, and leave the party to the other. But where the
grantee hath but one remedy, that remedy cannot be barred by any proviſo, for
ſuch a proviſo ſhould be repugnant to the grant. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

                  <p>And if a man by his Deed grant a rent Charge out of land
provid. that it ſhall not charge the Land, albeit the grantee hath a double
remedy, yet the proviſo is repugnant, becauſe the Land is expreſly
charged with the rent, but the Writ of <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33382:67"/> annuity is but
implyed in the grant, and therefore that may be reſtrained without any
repugnant, and ſufficient remedy left for the grantee; for which cauſe
<hi>Littl.</hi> putteth his caſe of the reſtraint of bringing a writ of
annuity. Alſo our Author putteth his caſe of a rent charge continuing; and

                  <p>And note a diverſity between a rent in groſſe, and a
rent incident to a reverſion.</p>
                  <p>If a man grant a rent charge out of two acres, and after the
grantee recovereth one of the acres againſt the grantor by a Title Paramount,
the whole rent ſhall iſſue out of the other acre: But if the Recovery be

he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under the grantor, <hi>Doct. &amp; Stud.</hi> l. 2: c. 17.</p>
                  <p>And yet in ſome caſes a rent charge ſhall not be wholly
extinct, where the grantee claimeth from and under the grantor. As if
<hi>B.</hi> make a leaſe of one acre for life to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi>

<hi>B.</hi> out of both acres: and doth waſte in the acre which he holdeth

that by the Rule of Law, a Livery of Seiſin muſt paſſe a preſent

with Reaſon, that a Freehold ſhould remain in the leſſor, againſt his

expect.</p>
                  <p>And they ſay further, That ſeeing all the Books
aforeſaid prove that ſuch a Condition is good, and that the Livery made to
the Leſſee is effectuall, by conſequence the Freehold and Inheritance
muſt paſſe preſently, or not at all; and it is not rare, ſay they, in
our Books, that words ſhall be tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and marſhalled, ſo as the

paſſeth not before the performance of the Condition, for that the Livery
may preſently work upon the Freehold: But otherwiſe it is in caſe of a

                  <p>For the caſe is but this, That a man make a leaſe of a

hold the Manour to him and his heirs by 12. <abbr>l.</abbr> rent, and (as it
muſt be intended) maketh Livery of Seiſin; in this caſe it is clear
(ſay they) that <hi>B.</hi> hath a Fee ſimple maintenant, for there is no
Condition precedent, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As for the caſe in 12 <hi>E.</hi> 2. the caſe is, That
<hi>J. de M.</hi> made a Charter to <hi>J. de Burford</hi> of Fee ſimple, and
the ſame day it was covenanted between them, That <hi>J. de B.</hi> ſhould
hold the ſame Tenements for 8 years, and if he did not pay 100 Mark at the
end of the term, that the land ſhall remain to <hi>J. de B.</hi> and his
heirs. In which caſe ſay they, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy &amp;c. for the
Covenant being made after the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. could neither alter the abſolute
Charter, nor upon a Condition precedent give him a Fee ſimple that had a Fee
before.</p>
                  <p>To all the other Books, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. &amp;c.

of thoſe Books, as in 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 10 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> &amp;c. it
appeareth, That there was a Charter made in ſurety of the Term, which ſay
they muſt be intended thus, <hi>viz.</hi> A man maketh a leaſe for years,
the leſſee enters, and the leſſor makes a Charter to the 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33382:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> leſſee, and thereby doth grant unto him, that
if he pay unto the leſſor 100 Mark during the term, That then he ſhall
have fee, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe, ſay they, there need no livery ſeiſin,

                  <p>A condition that is to create an eſtate, is to be
perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by conſtruction of Law, as near the condition as may be, and
according to the intent of the condition, albeit the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c. cannot be
performed. But otherwiſe it is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that deſtroyeth an eſtate,
for that is to be taken ſtrictly, unleſs it be in certain ſpecial
Caſes, &amp;c. As if a man mortgage his land to <hi>W.</hi> upon condition,
that if the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagor and I.S. pay 20 <abbr>s.</abbr> at ſuch a day to the
Mortgagee, that then he ſhall re-enter, the Mortgagor dyeth before the day
I.S. pay the money to the Mortgagee, this is a good perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the
condition. But if a man make a leaſe to two for years, with a proviſo, if
the leſſees dye during the term, the leſſor ſhall re-enter, one
leſſee alien his part and dye, the leſſor cannot re-enter, but the
Aſſignee ſhall enjoy the term ſo long as the ſurvivor liveth,
becauſe the leaſe by the proviſo is not to ceaſe till both be dead, 30

and ſo his Writ was good againſt D. ſole. And there the Counſel of the
Plaintiff took a diverſity between a rent reſerved, which is parcel of the
leaſe, and the land charged therewith, and a ſum in groſs, as here the 20
<abbr>l.</abbr> is; for as to the rent, they agreed, That by the agreement of
R. to the leaſe, he was bound to pay it, but for the 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> that
is a ſum in groſs, and collateral to the leaſe, and not annext to the
land, and groweth due onely by the Deed, and therefore R. ſaid he was not

in as much as he had agreed to the leaſe which was made by Indenture for the

                  <p>There is a diverſity between Officers that have no other

exerciſe whereof is but labour and charge to him, but he muſt have his Fee:

                  <p>There is another diverſity, where the grantee, beſides his

                  <p>Conditions in Law be of two natures, <hi>i.e.</hi> by the

<hi>i.e.</hi> the one is founded upon skill and confidence, as here the Office
of Parkerſhip; the other without skill or confidence; whereof ſome by the
Common Law, and ſome by the Statute. By the Common Law, as to every eſtate
of Tenant by the Curteſie, Tenant in Tail after poſſibility, &amp;c.
Tenant in Dower, Tenant for life, for years, Tenant by Statute Merchant, or
Staple, by Elegit, Gardian, &amp;c. there is a condition in Law ſecretly
annexed to their eſtates, that if they alien in fee, &amp;c. that he in the
reverſion or remainder may enter, &amp;c. or if they claim a greater eſtate
in Court of Record, &amp;c. <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 373. a. Sir <hi>H. Nevils</hi>

concerning condition in law foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="244" facs="tcp:33382:111"/> upon Statutes, for
ſome of them an entry is given, and for ſome other a recovery by action:
where an entry is given as upon an Alienation in Mortmain, &amp;c. and the like
where an action is given, as for Waſte againſt Tenant for life and years,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As for Example, admit that an office of Parkerſhip be
grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or deſcend to an Infant or feme Covert; if the conditions in law
annexed to this office which require skill and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be not obſerved
and fulfilled, the office is loſt for ever, becauſe it is as ſtrong as an
expreſs condition. But if a leaſe for life be made to a feme covert, or an
Infant, and they by Charter of Feoffment alien in fee, the breach of this
condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Law, that is, without skill, &amp;c. is no abſolute forfeiture
of their eſtate. So of a condition in Law given by Statute, which giveth an
entry onely. As if an Infant or feme Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert with husband, aliens by Charter of
Feoffment in Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, this is no barre to the Infant or feme Covert. But if a
recovery be had againſt an Infant or feme Covert in an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Waſte,
there they are bound and barred for ever.</p>
                  <p>And note, that a condition in Law by force of a Statute, which
giveth a recovery, is in ſome caſe ſtronger then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Law
without a recovery: for if leſſee for life make a leaſe for years, and
after enter into the land and make Waſte, and the leſſor recover in an
action of Waſte, he ſhall avoid the leaſe made before the waſte done,
(becauſe of neceſſity the action of Waſte muſt be brought againſt
the leſſee for life, which in that caſe muſt binde the leſſee for
years, or elſe by the act of the leſſee for life, the leſſor ſhould
be barred to recover <hi>locum vaſtatum,</hi> which the Statute giveth.) But
if the leſſee for life make a leaſe for years, and after enter upon him,
and make a Feoffment in fee, this forfeiture ſhall not avoid the leaſe for
years.</p>

Law, ſhall take the land with ſuch charge as he findes it.</p>
                  <p>And a condition in Law, is as ſtrong as a condition in Deed
as to avoid the eſtate, or intereſt it ſelf, but not precedent charges to
avoid, but in ſome particular caſes. <hi>

all the right which a man hath either in lands and tenements, or in goods and
chattels. Or there is a Releaſe of actions real, of or in lands or tenements;

                  <p>Expreſs Releaſes muſt of neceſſity be by Deed.
Releaſes in Law are ſometime by Deed, and ſometime without Deed. As if
the Lord diſſeaſe the Tenant, and make a Feoffment in fee by Deed or
without Deed, this is a Releaſe of the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory. And ſo it is if the
diſſeiſee diſſeiſe the heir of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor and make a
Feoffment &amp;c, this is a Releaſe in Law of the right. And the ſame Law
is of a right in action, 27 <hi>H</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Vſe</hi> 34 <hi>H</hi> 6.

releaſe in law of the action, but the duty remains, for

writ of cuſtoms and ſervices lyeth not againſt the Feoffor, nor a

made, an Aſſ. ſhall not lie againſt the Feoffor, and him that made the

incroached, ſhall be avoided; for theſe actions and acts concern the right,
but of a ſeiſin and avowry which concern the poſſeſſion, it is

them, as to the poſſeſſion, and diſcharge of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages, but the
Feoffee ſhall not take benefit of it, for that, it extended but to the right.
But the Feoffor ſhall plead a releaſe to the Feoffee, for thereby the
Seigniory is extinct, as if the leſſee for life doth waſt, and grant over
his eſtate, and the leſſer releaſe to the grantee, in an action of
waſt againſt the leſſee, he ſhall plead the releaſe, and yet he
hath nothing in the land; and ſo in waſt ſhall Tenant in Dower, or by the

the Lord accept the ſervice, or rent of the Feoffee due in his time, he
ſhall loſe the arrerages due in the time of the Feoffor, for after ſuch
acceptance, he ſhall not avow upon the Feoffor, nor upon the Feoffee, for the

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:33382:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> by him, it ſhall not enure by way of entry and

                  <p>If an alien be a diſſeiſor and obtain letters of

and for that the poſſeſſion was never actually removed, or reveſted
from the diſſeiſor, who claimeth under the Lord, the Seignory is not
revived. But if the Lord, and the ſtranger diſteiſe the Tenant, and the

wherein the Plaintiff is to recover, or to be reſtored to nothing againſt

Plaintiff in the Writ of Error of the Suit, and vexation by the Writ of Error.
And ſo note, that an action reall or perſonall doth imply a recovery of
ſomething in the realty, or perſonalty, or a reſtitution to the ſame,

this ſome have gathered, that if a diſſeiſor make a Leaſe for life,
reſerving the reverſion to himſelfe, and the diſſeiſee, confirme
the eſtate of the diſſeiſor, that he may enter upon the leſſee,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eſtate of him in the reverſion dependeth not upon the
eſtate for life as the remainder: but all is one, for by the confirmation
made to him in the reverſion, all the right of him that confirmeth is gone,
as well as when he maketh it to him in remainder: and he cannot by his entry
avoid the eſtate of the leſſee for life, but he muſt avoid the eſtate
of the leſſor, which againſt his own confirmation he cannot doe; and it
hath been adjudged, that if a diſſeiſor make a Leaſe for life, and
after levy a fine of the reverſion with proclamations, and the five years
paſſe, ſo as the diſſeiſee is for the reverſion barred, he
ſhall not enter upon the Leſſee for life. Reported by Sir <hi>Jo.
Popham</hi> chief Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Where the particular eſtate and the remainder depend upon
one title, there the defeating of the particular eſtate is a defeating of the
remainder. But where the particular eſtate is defeaſible, and the remainder
by good title, there though the particular eſtate be defeated, the remainder
is good. As if the leſſor diſſeiſe A. leſſee for life, and make a
Leaſe to B. for the life of A. the remainder to C. in fee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit A.
reenter, and defeate the eſtate for life, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to C. being once
veſted by good title, ſhall not be avoided, for it were againſt reaſon,
that the leſſor ſhould have the remainder againe againſt his own
livery. So it is if <pb n="328" facs="tcp:33382:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> a leaſe be made to an
Infant for life, the remainder in fee, the Infant at his ful age diſagree to
the eſtate for life, yet the remainder is good, <hi>Pl. Com.

                  <p>If a leaſe be made to A. for the life of B. the remainder to

                  <p>A rent is granted to the Tenant of the land for life, the

                  <p>Since <hi>Littleton</hi> wrote, if a Fine be levied of a
Seigniory, &amp;c. to another, to the uſe of a third perſon and his heirs,
he and his heirs ſhall diſtrain without any Attornment, becauſe he is in
by the Statute of 27 H. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. by transferring the ſtate to the

                  <p>So it is if a man by Deed indented and inrolled according to
the Statute, bargain and ſell a Seigniory, &amp;c. to another, the Seigniory
ſhall paſſe without Attornment; and ſo it is of

                  <p>But if the Conuſee of a Fine, before any Attornment by Deed
indented and inrolled, bargain and ſell the Seigniory to another, the
bargainee ſhall not diſtrain, becauſe the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor could not
diſtrain, <hi>&amp; ſic de ſimilibus;</hi> for <hi>Nemo poteſt

                  <p>A grant to the King, or by the King to another, is good

                  <p>If there be Lord, Meſne and Tenant, and the Meſne grant
over his Meſnalty by Deed, the Lord releaſe to the Tenant, whereby the
Meſnalty is extinct, and there is a rent by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage, an Attornment to
the grant of this rent ſeck is good, although the quality of that part of the
rent is altered, becauſe it is altered by act in Law.</p>
                  <p>If a reverſion of two acres be granted by Deed, and the
leſſor before Attornment levy a Fine of one of them, and the Tenant attorn

                  <p>If the reverſion be granted of three acres, and the
leſſee agree to the ſaid grant for one acre, this is good for all three,

                  <p>Impliedly, as if a reverſion be granted to two by Deed, and
the leſſee Attorn to one of them according to the grant, this Attornment
ſhall enure to both the grantees; and ſo it is if one grantee dye, the
Attornment to the ſurvivor is good, 11 H. 7. 12.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord grant by Deed his Seigniory to A. for life, the
remainder to B in fee, A. dyeth, and then the Tenant Attorn to B. this
Attornment is void, becauſe it is not according to the grant, for then B.

                  <p>If a reverſion be granted to a man and a woman, they are to
have moities in Law; but if they intermarry, and then Attornment is had, they

                  <p>If in the caſe that our Author here putteth of ſeverall

                  <p>If a reverſion be granted for life, and after it is granted

is void for the uncertainty, 11 H. 7. 12.</p>

par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of a Manor, and rents and Services incident to a reverſion parcel of
a Manor. And the reaſon of this diverſitie is, for that as long as the
donee in taile, leſſee for life or leſſee for yeares, are in
poſſeſſion, they preſerve the reverſion in the donor or leſſor,
and ſo long as the reverſion continue in the donor or leſſor, ſo long
do the rents and ſervices, which are incidents to the reverſion belong to
the donor or leſſor. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the donor or leſſor be put out of his
reverſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the donee, or leſſee be out of their
poſſeſſion, &amp;c. But if the donee or leſſee make a regreſſe,
and regain their eſtate and poſſeſſion, thereby they doe <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> reveſt the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the donor or leſſor.</p>
                  <p>And note, when a man is ſeiſed of a Manor and maketh a
gift in taile, or Leaſe for life, &amp;c. Of parcel of the demeſne of the
Manor; the reverſion is part of the Manor, and by the grant of the Manor the
reverſion ſhall paſſe with the Attornment of the Donee or leſſee.
But if the Lord make a gift or a Leaſe for life of the whole Manor, except
bl. acre <pb n="344" facs="tcp:33382:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> parcell of the demeſne of the Manor,
and after he grant away his Manor, B. acre ſhall not paſſe, becauſe
during the eſtate taile, or Leaſe for life, it is ſevered from the Manor.
And ſo note a diverſity, that a reverſion of part, may be parcell of a
Manor in poſſeſſion, but a part in poſſeſſion cannot be parcell
of the reverſion of a Manor expectant upon any eſtate of freehold. But if a
man make a Leaſe for yeares of a Manor except B. acre, and after grant away
the Manor, B. acre ſhall paſſe, becauſe the freehold being entire, it
remaineth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Manor, and one <hi>praecipe</hi> of the whole Manor
ſhall ſerve. But otherwiſe it is in caſe of a gift in taile, or Leaſe
for life, excepting any part, there muſt be ſeverall Writs of
<hi>Praecipe,</hi> becauſe the freehold is ſeverall, 18. <hi>Aſſ.

doth attorn without ſaving his priviledge, that he hath loſt it, which is
to be underſtood, where he attorneth in a <hi>Quid juris clamat</hi> brought

is barred for ever to claim any priviledge but a bare eſtate for life. But if
upon a grant of the reverſion by Deed, the Tenant for life doth attorn, he
loſeth no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, for there can be no concluſion or barre by the

                  <p>But there is a diverſity between alienation, working a
diſcontinuance of an eſtate, which taketh away an entry; and an alienation
working, diveſting or diſplacing of eſtates, which take away no entry. As
if there be Tenant for life, the remainder to <hi>A.</hi> in taile, the
remainder to <hi>B.</hi> in fee, if <pb n="361" facs="tcp:33382:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> Tenant for
life doth alien in fee, this doth diveſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the remainders, but
worketh no diſcontinuance; and ſo note that to every diſcontinuance,
there is neceſſary a dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or diſplacing the eſtate, and
turning the ſame to a right: for if it be not turned to a right, they that
have the Eſtate, cannot be driven to an action; &amp; therefore ſuch
inheritances as lye in grant, cannot by grant be diſcontinued, becauſe
ſuch a grant diveſts no Eſtate, but paſſeth only that which he may
lawfully grant, and ſo the Eſtate it ſelf doth deſcend, revert, or
remaine, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter.</p>
                  <p>A. maketh a gift in tail to B. who maketh a gift in tail to C.
C. maketh a feoffment in fee, and dyeth without iſſue. B. hath iſſue
and dyeth, the iſſue of B. ſhall enter, for albeit the feoffment of C.
did diſcontinue in reverſion of the fee ſimple, which B had gained upon
the eſtate tail made to C. yet it could not diſcontinue the right of
entaile which B. had, which was diſcontinued before: and therefore when C.
died without iſſue, then did the diſcontinuance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate taile of
B. which paſſed by his livery ceaſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the entry of the
iſſue of B. lawfull. * Alſo nate that a diſcontinuance made by the
husband, did take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the entry only of the wife, and her heirs by the common
Law, and not of any other which claimed by title para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount above the
diſcontinuance. As if lands had beene given the husband and wife and to a
third perſon, and to their heires, and the husband had made a feoffment in
fee, this had been a diſcontinuance of the one moity, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin
of the other moity: if the husband had dyed, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor ſhould have
entred in the whole, for he claimed not under the diſcontinuance, but by
title paramount, from the firſt feoffor, and ſeeing the right by law doth
ſurvive, the Law doth give him a remedy, to take advantage thereof by entry,
for other remedy, for that moity he could not have.</p>

                  <p>Note, there be 3 kinds of Surrender, <hi>viz.</hi> a Surrender
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken at the Common Law, which is a yielding up of an eſtate for
life or years to him that hath an immediate eſtate in reverſion or
remainder, wherein the eſtate for life or years may drown by mutuall
agreement between them. 2. A Surrender by Cuſtom of Lands holden by Coppy, or
of Cuſtomary eſtate, <hi>vide</hi> Sect. 74. <hi>homo com. gen.</hi> *
* And 3. A Surrender improperly taken (<hi>vide S.</hi> 550.) of a Deed.

of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1: A Surrender in Deed, by expreſſe words,
whereof <hi>Littleton</hi> here putteth an Example; and he putteth his caſe
of a Surrender of an eſtate in poſſeſſion, for a right can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be
ſureendered. 2. A ſurrender in Law, which in ſome caſes is of greater
force, then a Surrender in Deed.</p>
                  <p>As if a man make a leaſe for years to begin at Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
next, this future intereſt cannot be ſurrendred, becauſe there is no
reverſion wherein it may drown, but by a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Law it may be
drowned.</p>
                  <p>As if the Leſſee before Michaelmas take a new leaſe for

Law of the former leaſe. <hi>Fortior, et aequior eſt dispoſitio legis

                  <p>And albeit a particular eſtate be made of lands by Deed, yet
may it be ſurrendred without Deed, in reſpect of the nature and quality of
the thing demiſed, becauſe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular might have beene made without
Deed. and ſo on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>If a man be * Tenant by the Curteſie, or Tenant in Dower

begin without Deed, yet in reſpect of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of the thing
that lies in grant, it cannot be ſurrendred without Deed. And ſo if a
leaſe for life be made of lands, the remainder for life, albeit the remainder
for life began without Deed, yet becauſe remainder and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though
they be of lands, are things that lie in grant, they cannot be ſurrendred
without Deed. <hi>Qu. fi le fits la feme poit enter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is holden of ſome, That after the ſurrender, the
iſſue in <pb n="371" facs="tcp:33382:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> Tail during the life of Tenant for
life may enter, for that having regard to the iſſue, the ſtate for life
is drowned, and conſequently the inheritance gained by the leaſe, is by the
acceptance of the ſurrender vaniſhed and gone; as if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Tail make a
leaſe for life, whereby he gaineth a new reverſion, if Tenant for life
ſurrender to the Tenant in Tail, the eſtate for life being drowned, the
reverſion gained by wrong is vaniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he is Tenant in
Tail again againſt the opinion <hi>Obiter</hi> of <hi>Portington,</hi> 21
<hi>H.</hi> 6. 53. <hi>vide</hi> lib. <hi>fo.</hi> 338. <hi>b. Mes il noſt
rien a faire, pur ceo que tout le matter eſt icy tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
verbatim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But herein are two diverſities (Notable) The firſt is that
having regard to the parties to the ſurrender, the eſtate is abſolutely
drowned, as in this caſe between the leſſee, and the ſecond Baron. But
having regard to ſtrangers, who were not parties or privies thereunto, leſt
by a voluntary ſurrender they may receive prejudice, touching any right or
intereſt they had before the ſurrender, the eſtate ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hath in
conſideration of Law a Continuance.</p>
                  <p>As if a reverſion be granted with Warranty, and Tenant for
life ſurrender, the grantee ſhall not have execution in value againſt the
grantor, who is a ſtranger, during the life of Tenant for life; for this
ſurrender ſhall work no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the grantee, who is a ſtranger, 45
<hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 9. 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>So if Tenant for life ſurrender to him in reverſion, being
within age, he ſhall not have his age, for that ſhould be a prejudice to a
ſtranger, who is become Demandant in a real action, 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. 1
<hi>H.</hi> 6. 1. 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 77.</p>
                  <p>If Tenant for life grant a rent charge, and after
ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet the rent remaineth; for to that purpoſe he cometh in under
the Charge, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 8. 26 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 38. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1.
b.</p>
                  <p>If a Biſhop be ſeiſed of a rent charge in fee, the
Tenant of the land infeoff the Biſhop and his ſucceſſors, the Lord
enter for the Mortmain, he ſhall hold it diſcharged of the rent, for the
entry for the Mortmain affirmeth the alienation <pb n="372" facs="tcp:33382:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Mortmain, and the Lord claimeth under his eſtate; but if Tenant for life
grant a rent in fee, and after infeoff the grantee, and the leſſor enter
for the forfeiture, the rent is revived, for the leſſor doth claim above
the Feoffment. But if I grant the reverſion of my Tenant for life to another
for term of his life, and Tenant for life attorn, now is the waſte of Tenant
for life diſhpuniſhable, 48 E. 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards I releaſe to the grantee for life and his heirs,
or grant the reverſion to him and his heirs, now albeit the Tenant for life
be a ſtranger to it, yet becauſe he attorneth to the grantee for life, the
eſtate for life which the grantee had, ſhall have no continuance in the eye
of Law as to him, but he ſhall be puniſhed for Waſte done afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond diverſity is, That for the benefit of an
eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the eſtate for life is abſolutely determined.</p>
                  <p>As if he in the reverſion make a leaſe for years, or grant
a rent charge, &amp;c. and then the leſſee for life ſurrender, the
leaſe or rent ſhall commence maintenance.</p>
                  <p>So in the caſe of <hi>Littleton,</hi> firſt between the
leſſee, and the ſecond husband, the ſtate for life is determined. And
2. for the benefit of the iſſue it ſhall be ſo adjudged in Law. Here
note a diverſity when it is to the prejudice of a ſtranger, and when it is
for his benefit.</p>
                  <p>If a man make a leaſe to A. for life, reſerving a rent of
40.<abbr>s.</abbr> to him and his heirs, the remainder to B. for life, the
leſſor grant the reverſion in fee to B. A. attorneth, B. ſhall not have
the rent, for that although the fee ſimple do drown the remainder for life
between them, yet as to a ſtranger it is in <hi>eſse,</hi> and therefore B.
ſhall not have the rent, but his heir ſhall have it.</p>
                  <p>A Maſter of an Hoſpital being a ſole Corporation, by the
conſent of his Brethren makes a leaſe for years of part of the
poſſeſſion of the Hoſpital; afterwards the leſſee for years is
made Maſter, the term is drowned, for a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a term for years in
his own right, and a Freehold <hi>en auter droit,</hi> to conſiſt together
(as if a man leſſee for years take a feme leſſor to wife.) But a man
may have a Freehold <pb n="373" facs="tcp:33382:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> in his own right, and a term
<hi>in auter droit;</hi> and therefore if a man leſſor take the feme
leſſee to wife, the term is not drawned, but he is poſſeſſed of the
term in her right during the Coverture, 6 H. 4. 7. <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 419.</p>
                  <p>So if the leſſee make the leſſor his executor, the
term is not drowned, 32 H. 8. <hi>Br. Surr.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>But if it had been a Corporation aggregate of many, the making
of the leſſee Maſter had not extinguiſhed the term, no more then if the
leſſee had been made one of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Hoſpital.</p>

Leaſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by his death, as if Tenant for life had made a Leaſe,
no acceptance of the rent by the ſucceſſor can make it good. Alſo in a

caſe the particular Tenant was without remedy at the common Law, becauſe he
could not have a writ of right. There hath been a queſtion in our Books upon
theſe words by default, &amp;c. And ſome do hold contrary to three
Objections made, &amp;c. and as to the firſt they ſay, That albeit that in
the writ of waſte, judgement is not only given upon the default, yet the
default is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and the cauſe of awarding of the writ, to enquire
of the waſte is an incident thereunto: and the Law alwayes hath reſpect to
the firſt and principal cauſe, and therefore upon ſuch a Recovery, a writ
of deceit lieth, and that writ lyeth not but where the recovery is by default.

<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but the place waſted is worthier being in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,

is the principal, becauſe the ſtatute of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> doth give the
place waſted and treble dammages at one time, for no prohibition or action of

                  <p>And in an action of waſte, if the defendant confeſſe the
action, the plaintiffe may have judgement for the place wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and
releaſe the damages which proveth that the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas are not the principal, for
a man ſhall never releaſe the principle, and have judgement of the
Acceſſory, and an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="398" facs="tcp:33382:188"/> of waſte againſt
Tenant for life, is as reall, as an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt Tenant in Dower; and as
to the caſe of 9 H. 5. It was anſwered, that it was an action in the
Tenuit, which is only in the perſonalty, and then the releaſe of one doth
barre both, neither could ſummons and ſeverance lye in that caſe, but in
an action of waſt (in the Tenet) either againſt Tenant for life, or yeers,
the releaſe of the one doth not bar the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in thoſe two caſes,
Summons and ſeverance doth lye- 6 E. 3, 47. 48. E. 319.</p>
                  <p>But when theſe 3. parts were reſolved by the Court for the

another point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the judgement was given upon a <hi>nihil

and there upon judgement was ſtayed.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Littleton.</hi> Here he openeth a

life at the common Law was remedileſſe, becauſe he could not have a writ
of right, and conſequently the feme Covert in this caſe could not be

right was reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe, and could have no action, But when an act of

the huſband and wife (the wife being Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life) the ſaid ſtatute
gave a <hi>quod ei deforceat</hi> to the Huſband and wife, for that the

here the Huſband is <pb n="399" facs="tcp:33382:188" rendition="simple:additions"/> not Tenant for life, but
ſeiſed in the right of his wife, and therefore out of the ſtatute; and of
this opinion is one book, * But <hi>Apices juris non ſunt jura, &amp;

                  <p>And the like in caſe of Reſceit for him in reverſion.
But if the husband loſe by default, and the husband die, the wife ſhall not

in that caſe by a former ſtatute, <hi>viz. W.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 3.</p>

at the common Law upon a diſſeiſin. <hi>Fo.</hi> 356. a.</p>
                  <p>When the reverſion is deveſted, the leſſor cannot have
an action of waſte, becauſe the Writ is, That the Leſſee did waſte
<hi>ad exhaeredationem</hi> of the Leſſor, and that inheritance muſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at the time of the action brought.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Nota,</hi> That in an action of waſte brought by the
leſſor againſt the leſſee, the Leſſee in reſpect of the privity
cannot plead generall * <hi>riens en le reverſion.</hi> But he muſt
ſhew how and by what means the reverſion is deveſted out of him: and this
holdeth between the leſſor and leſſee; but if the grantee of a
reverſion bring an action of waſte, the leſſee may plead generally,
That he hath nothing in the reverſion. 45. E. 3. 21. 44. E. 3. 34, 35. F.N.B.

                  <p>And yet in ſome ſpeciall caſes an action of waſte
ſhall lie, albeit the leſſor had nothing in the reverſion at the time
of the waſte done. As if Tenant for life make a feoffment in Fee upon
condition, and waſte is done, and after the leſſee reenter for the
condition broken, in this caſe the leſſor ſhall have an action of
waſte. And ſo if a Riſhop make a leaſe for life or yeers, and the
Biſhop die, the leſſee, the Sea being void doth waſte, the
ſucceſſor ſhall have an action of waſte. So if Leſſee for life be
diſſeiſed, and waſte is done, the leſſee reenter, an action of
waſte ſhall be maintained againſt the leſſee, and ſo in like
caſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:33382:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>Here note, that albeit the action

But if Tenant for life ſuffer a common reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or any other recovery by

                  <p>Concerning the 1. There be two points in Law to be

                  <p>Note a diverſity between a warranty on the part of the
Mother and an eſtoppel; for an eſtoppel, &amp;c. ſhall not binde the
heir, when he claimeth from the Father: As if Lands be given to the huſband
and wife, and to the heires of the huſband, the husband make a gift in Tail
and dieth, the wife recover in a <hi>Cui</hi> in <hi>vita</hi> againſt the

Eſtopped. 18 E 3. 9.</p>

                  <p>I will only adde two caſes, the one was. A man ſeiſed of
Lands in fee, levyed a fine to the uſe of himſelf for life, and after to
the uſe of his wife, and of the heirs males of her body by him begotten for
her joynture, and had iſſue male, <pb n="412" facs="tcp:33382:195"/> and after he and
his wife, levied a fine, and ſuffered a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon recovery, the huſband and
wife die, and the iſſue male enter by force of the ſaid Statute of 11 H.
7. and it was holden by the juſtices of Aſſ. that the entry, &amp;c. was
lawful, and yet this caſe is out of the letter of the Statute, for ſhe
neither levied the Fine, &amp;c. Being ſole, or with any other after taken
husband, but is by her ſelf with her huſband that made the joynture.
<hi>Sed qui haeret in littera haeret in Cortice;</hi> &amp; this caſe being
in the ſame miſchief, is therefore within the remedy of the Statute, by the
intendment of the makers of the ſame, to avoid the diſheriſon of heirs,
who were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſaid joynture, and eſpecially by the huſband
himſelf, that made the joynture. <hi>M.</hi> 13. <hi>Jac. inter.</hi> Harley,
<hi>and</hi> Weſt <hi>in eject. fir. in Com.</hi> B. <hi>Linc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other was, A man is ſeiſed of Lands in the right of
his wife, and they two levy a Fine, and the Conuſee grant, and render the
Land to the husband and wife in eſpecial taile, the remainder to the right
heirs of the wife, they have iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, the husband dyeth, the wife taketh
another husband; and they two levy a Fine in Fee, and the iſſue enter, this
is directly within the Letter of the Statute, and yet is out of the meaning,
becauſe the State of the Land moved from the wife, ſo as it was the
purchaſe of the Husband in Letter, and not in meaning. P. 17. <hi>El. in Com.
B Lattons</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>But where the woman is Tenant for life, by the gift or
conveyance of any other, her alienation with warranty ſhall binde the heir at
this day. So if a man be Tenant for life (otherwiſe than as Tenant <hi>per
Curteſie</hi>) and alien in fee with warranty and dyeth, this ſhall at this
day binde the heir, that hath the reverſion or remainder by the Common Law,
not holpen by any Statute. But all this is to be underſtood, unleſſe the
heir that hath the reverſion or remainder, doth avoid the eſtate ſo
aliened in the life of the Anceſtor, for then the eſtate being avoided, the
warranty being annexed unto the eſtate is avoided alſo, <hi>Sect.</hi>
725.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond clauſe of the Statute of
<hi>Gloceſtor,</hi> there are two points of Law to be obſerved,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:33382:195"/>1. That by the expreſſe
purview of the Statute, if Aſſets do after deſcend from the Father, then
the Tenant ſhall have recovery or reſtitution of the lands of the Mother.
But in a Formedon, if at the time of the warranty pleaded, no Aſſets be
deſcended whereby the Demandant recovereth, if after the Aſſets
deſcend, there the Tenant ſhall have a <hi>Sc. fac.</hi> for the
Aſſets, and not for the land intailed; becauſe that if in this caſe the
Tenant ſhould be reſtored to the land intail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then if the iſſue in

                  <p n="2">2. Note, That after Aſſets deſcended, the recovery
ſhall be by writ of Judgement (<hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Sc. fac.</hi>) which
ſhall iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of the Roll of the Juſtices, &amp;c. (to reſummon
him that ought to warrant, &amp;c.) Alſo if the Tenant will have benefit of
the Statute, he muſt plead the Warranty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Title of the
Demandant, and pray that the advantage of the Statute may be ſaved unto him;
and then if after Aſſets deſcend, the Tenant upon this Record ſhall
have a <hi>ſc. fac.</hi> and if Aſſets deſcend but for part, he ſhall
have a <hi>ſcire fac.</hi> for ſo much, <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>fo.</hi> 134.
<hi>Mary Shipleys</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>But if the Tenant plead the Warranty, and Aſſets
deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp;c. and the Demandant taketh iſſue that Aſſets not,
&amp;c. which iſſue is found for the Demandant, whereupon he recovereth,
the Tenant albeit Aſſets do after deſcend, ſhall never have a
<hi>ſcire fac.</hi> upon the ſaid Judgement, for that by his falſe plea
he hath loſt the benefit of the ſaid Statute. <hi>fol.</hi> 366. a.</p>
                  <p>Touching the third, ſufficient hath been ſpoken
before.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt, <hi>Nota,</hi> That if the huſband be
ſeized of lands in right of his wife, and maketh a Feoffment in fee with
Warranty, the wife dyeth, and the huſband dyeth, this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty ſhall not
binde the heir of the wife without Aſſets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the huſband be not
Tenant by the Curteſie, 8 E. 2. <hi>gar.</hi> 81. 18. E. 3. 51.</p>
                  <p>A Warranty may not onely be annexed to Freeholds, or
Inheritance corporeal, which paſs by Livery, as houſes and 
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33382:196"/> lands, but alſo to Freeholds or Inheritances
incorporeal, which lie in grant, as Advowſons, and to Rents, Common

Inheritances in <hi>eſſe,</hi> but alſo to Rents, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, &amp;c. newly
created. As a man (ſome ſay) may grant a Rent, &amp;c. out of land for life
in Tail or in fee with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty; for although there can be no Title precedent
to the Rent, yet there may be a Title precedent to the land, out of which it
iſſueth before the grant of the Rent, which rent may be avoided by the
recovery of the land, in which caſe the grantee may help himſelf by a
<hi>Warrantia Cartae,</hi> upon the eſpecial matter, and ſo a Warranty in
Law may extend to a rent &amp;c. newly created; and therefore if a rent newly

ſhould binde as a collateral Warranty, and therefore commencing by

                  <p>By the Statute of 1 R. 2 c. 9. it is enacted, That feoffments

                  <p>Now ſince <hi>Littleton</hi> wrote, there is a notable
Statute 32 H. 8. c. 9. made in ſuppreſſion of the cauſes of unlawfull
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, The effect of which Statute is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no perſon ſhall bargain, buy, ſell, or
obtain any pretenced Rights or Titles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or take, promiſe, grant, or Covenant to have any
Right or Title of any perſon, in, or to any lands, &amp;c. but if ſuch
perſon which ſo ſhall bargain, &amp;c. their Anceſtors, or they by whom
he or they claim the ſame, have been in poſſeſſion of the ſame, or
of the reverſion, or remainder thereof, or <pb n="418" facs="tcp:33382:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taken the * rents or profits thereof by the ſpace of one whole year,
&amp;c. upon pain to forfeit the whole value of the lands, &amp;c. and the
buyer or taker, &amp;c. knowing the ſame, to forfeit alſo the value. *
Thoſe words are but explanatory, and put for example, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Provided that it ſhall be lawfull for any perſon
being in lawfull poſſeſſion, &amp;c. to obtain or get the pretenced
Right or Title, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nota,</hi> That Title or Right may be pretenced two manner
of wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it is meerly in pretence or ſuppoſition, and
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in verity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it is a good Right or Title in verity, and made
pretenced by the act of the party, and both theſe are within the ſaid
Statute: For example;</p>
                  <p>If A. be lawfull owner of land, and is in poſſeſſion,
B. that hath no right thereunto grant to A or contracteth for the land with
another, the grantor and the grantee (albeit the grant be meerly void) are
within the danger of the Statute, for B. hath no right at all but onely in
pretence.</p>
                  <p>If A. be diſſeiſed in this caſe, A. hath a good
lawfull right, yet if A. being out of poſſeſſion, grant to, or
contracteth for the land with another, he hath made now his good right of Entry
pretenced within the Statute, and both the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the grantee within the
danger thereof, <hi>A fortiori</hi> of a right of Action, <hi>quod nota. Pl.
Com.</hi> 80, <hi>&amp;c. Partridges</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be known, That a Right or Title may be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered three manner of wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it is naked and without poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the abſolute Right cometh by releaſe or
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to a wrongfull poſſeſſion, and no third perſon hath
either <hi>jus proprietatis,</hi> or <hi>jus poſſeſſionis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he hath a good right and a wrongfull
poſſeſſion. As to the firſt ſomewhat hath been ſaid. As to the
ſecond, taking the former example, If A. be diſſeiſed, and the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee releaſe unto him, he may preſently ſell, grant or
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <pb n="419" facs="tcp:33382:198" rendition="simple:additions"/> for the land, and need not tarry a
yeer; for it is a rule upon this Statute, that whoſoever hath the abſolute
owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any Land, tenements, or haereditaments (as in this caſe the
diſſeiſor hath) there ſuch owner may at his pleaſure bargaine, grant,
or contract for the land; for no perſon can thereby be prejudiced, or
grieved. 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Br. Maintenance</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>And ſo if a man Morgage his Land, and after redeem the

ancient right, he may at any time bargaine, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As to the third, if in the caſe aforeſaid, the
diſſeiſor dyeth ſeiſed, and A. the diſſeiſee enter, and
diſſeiſe the heir of the diſſeiſor, albeit he hath an ancient
right, yet ſeeing the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is unlawfull, if he bargaine or
contract for the land before he hath been in poſſeſſion, by the ſpace
of a yeer, he is within the danger of the Statute; becauſe the heir of the
diſſeiſor hath right to the poſſeſſion; and he is thereby
grieved, <hi>&amp; ſic de ſimilibus.</hi>

                  <p>If Tenant in Tail in poſſeſſion, or that hath a right

Act hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to theſe words <hi>(given or granted)</hi> and
<hi>(Remainder)</hi> hath reference to theſe words <hi>(otherwiſe

of Land; or for other conſiderations, by way of proviſion, procure a
Subject by Deed indented and inrolled, to make a gift in Tail to one of his
Servants and Subjects, for recompence of ſervice or other conſideration,
the remainder to the King in fee, and all this appear of Record; this is a good
proviſion within the Statute, and the Tenant in Tail cannot by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <p n="1">1. That a lineal Warranty doth binde the right of a fee

                  <p n="3">3. That a lineal Warranty and Aſſets is a bar of the
right in Tail, and is not reſtrained by the ſaid Act.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a collateral Warranty made by a collateral
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor of the donee, doth binde the right of an eſtate Tail, albeit
there be no Aſſets; and the reaſon thereof is upon the Statute of
<hi>Donis Cond,</hi> for that it is not made by the Tenant in tail, &amp;c. as
the lineal Warranty is, 3 E. 3. 22. 4 E. 3. 28. 50. <hi>M.</hi> 38 E. 3.

                  <p>To this may be added, That the Warranty of the Donee in Tail,
which is collateral to the Donor, or to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, being heir to him,
doth binde them without any Aſſets. For though the alienation of the Donee
after iſſue doth not bar the Donor, which was the miſchief provided for
by the Act, yet the Warranty being collateral, doth bar both of them, for the
Act reſtraineth not that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, but it remaineth at the Common Law, as
<hi>Littleton</hi> 
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:33382:203"/> after ſaith. And in like manner the

                  <p>Every Warranty doth deſcend upon him that is heire to him

737.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon many things worthy to be known, are to be
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. 1. That if a man infeoff another of an acre of ground with
Warranty, and hath iſſue two Sons, and dyeth ſeiſed of another acre of
land of the nature of Borough Engliſh, the feoffee is impleaded; albeit the
Warranty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth onely upon the eldeſt, yet may he vouch them both; the
one as heir to the Warranty, and the other as heir to <pb n="430" facs="tcp:33382:204"/>
the Land. 40 E. 3. 14. So it is of heirs in Gavelkinde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 22 E.
4. 10. And in like ſort the heir at the Common Law, and the heir of the part
of the Mother ſhall be vouched. 49 Aſſ. 4. 38. E. 3. 22. But the heir at
the Common Law may be vouched alone in both theſe caſes, at the election of
the Tenant; <hi>&amp; ſic de ſimilibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo if a man dye ſeiſed of certain lands in fee, having
iſſue a Son and a daughter by one venter, and a Son by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the
eldeſt Son enters and dieth, the land deſcends to the ſiſter; in this
caſe the warranty deſcendeth on the Son, and he may be vouched as heir, and
the ſiſter as heir of the land.</p>
                  <p>In which caſe, and in the other caſe of Borough Engliſh,
the Son and heir by the Common Law having nothing by diſcent, the whole
loſs of the recovery in value, lieth upon the heires of the land, albeit they
be no heires to the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 32 E. 3. vouch. 94. 35 H. 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>Then put the caſe, that there is a warranty paramount, who
ſhall deraign, that warranty, and to whom ſhall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence in value
go? ſome have ſaid, that as they are vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together, ſo ſhall they
avouch over, and that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in value ſhall enure according to the
loſſe, and that the effect muſt purſue the cauſe, as a recovery in
value by a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty of the part of the Mother ſhall go to the heire of the
part of the Mother, &amp;c. <hi>Pl. Come.</hi> 515.</p>
                  <p>Some others hold, that it is againſt the maxime of the Law,
that they that are not heirs to the warranty ſhould joyn in a voucher, or to
take benefit of the waranty which deſcends not to them, but that the heir at
the common Law, to whom the warranty deſcended, ſhall deraign the warranty,
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove in value, and that this doth ſtand with the rule of the common
Law.</p>
                  <p>Others hold the contrary, and that this ſhould be both
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of Law, and againſt reaſon alſo; for by the rule of
Law, the vouchee ſhall never ſue to have execution in value, untill
execution be ſued againſt him. But in this caſe excution can never be
ſued againſt the heir at the common <pb n="431" facs="tcp:33382:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> Law,
therefore he cannot ſue to have execution over in value. Secondly it ſhould
be againſt reaſon, that the heire at the common law ſhould have <hi>totum

                  <p>I find in our Books, this reaſon is yielded, that the
ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al heires ſhould not be vouched only; for (ſay they) then could not
they deraigne the warranty, which ſhould be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, that they
ſhould loſe the benefit of the warranty, if they ſhould be vouched onely.

                  <p>But if the heire at the Common Law were vouched with them, (as
by the Law he ought) all might be ſaved; and therefore ſtudy well this
point, how it may be done.</p>
                  <p>If Tenant in general Tail be, and a common recovery is had
againſt him, and his wife, where his wife hath nothing, and they vouch, and
have judgement to recover in value, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Tail dyeth, and the wife
ſurviveth; for that the iſſue in Tail had the whole loſſe, the
recompence ſhall enure wholly to him, and the wife albeit ſhe was party to
the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall have nothing in the recompence, for that ſhe loſeth
nothing. <hi>Pl. Com. Fo.</hi> 514.</p>
                  <p>If the Baſtard eigne enter, and take the profits, he ſhall
be vouched onely, and not the Baſtard and the Mulier, becauſe the Baſtard
is in apparance heire, and ſhall not diſable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 17 E. 3. 59. 20 E.

                  <p>Here by the Opinion of <hi>Littleton,</hi> the Donor may
re-enter for the condition broken, for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile per inutile non
vitiatur,</hi> which being in caſe of a condition, for the defeating of an
eſtate, is worthy of Obſervation. And it is to be noted, That after the
death of the Donor, the condition deſcendeth to the eldeſt Sonne, and
conſequently his alienation doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſame for ever, wherein
the weakneſſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention appeareth; and therefore
<hi>Littleton</hi> here ſaith, That it ſeemeth that the Donor may re-enter,
and ſpeaketh nothing of his heirs.</p>
                  <p>A man hath iſſue two Sons, and maketh a gift in Tail to
the eldeſt, the remainder in fee to the puiſne, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the
eldeſt ſhall not make any diſcontinuance with warranty to barre him in
the remainder, and if he doth, that then the puiſne Son and his heirs ſhall
re-enter; the eldeſt maketh a feoffment in fee with warranty, the Father
dyeth, the eldeſt Son dyeth without iſſue, the puiſne may enter. But if
the diſcontinuance had been after the death of the Father, the puiſne could
not have entred.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe four points are to be obſerved:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As <hi>Littleton</hi> here ſaith, the entry for the
breach of the Condition is given to the Father, and not to the puiſne
Sonne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That by the death of the Father the condition
deſcends to the elder Sonne, and is but ſuſpended, and is revived by the
death of the eldeſt Son without iſſue, and deſcendeth to the yongeſt
Son, 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>vide Sect.</hi> 446.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the feoffment made in the life of the Father, 
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33382:207"/> cannot give away a condition that is collaterall, as it
may doe a right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a Warranty cannot binde a Title of entry for a
condition broken, but if the diſcontinuance had been made after the death of
the Father, it had extinguiſht the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which caſe is put to open
the reaſon of our Authors opinion.</p>

within age at the time of the alienation with Warranty, and become of full age

                  <p>Our Author putteth his caſes where the entry of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
is lawfull; for where it is not lawfull when the Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſcendeth, the
Warranty doth binde the Infant, as well as a man of full age; and the reaſon
is, becauſe the ſtate whereunto the Warranty was annexed continueth, and
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided but by action, in which action the Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a barre. And
ſo it is of a Feme covert, if her entry be not lawfull, a Warranty

728. **</p>
                  <p>Note three things concerning the conſtruction of
Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is the moſt naturall and genuine
Expoſition of a Statute, to conſtrue one part by another, &amp;c. for that
beſt expreſſeth the meaning of the makers, <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 75. 7
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 89. As here the queſtion upon the generall words of the
Statute is, Whether a Fine levied only by a husband ſeiſed in the right of
his wife with Warranty, ſhall barre the heir without Aſſets? And it is
well expounded by the former part of the Act, whereby it is Enacted, That
Alienation made by Tenant by the Curteſie with Warranty, ſhall not barre
the heir, unleſſe the Aſſets deſcend. <hi>Bract. lib.</hi> 4.
<hi>fol.</hi> 321. <hi>Fleta lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. And therefore it
ſhould be inconvenient to intend the Statute in ſuch manner, as that he
that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in the right of his wife, ſhould by his Fine levied
with Warranty barre the heir without Aſſets: and this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is
<hi>ex viſceribus actus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words of an Act of Parliament muſt be taken in
a lawfull ſenſe, as here the words being <hi>[Whereof no Fine is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in
the Kings Court]</hi> are to be underſtood, whereof no Fine is lawfully or
rightfully levied &amp;c. and therefore a Fine levied by the husband alone, is
not within the meaning of the Statute, for that Fine ſhould work a wrong to
the wife; but a Fine levied by the husband and wife, is intended by 
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:33382:208" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Statute, for that Fine is lawfull, and
worketh no wrong, <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 246. <hi>Seignieur Barklays</hi> caſe,
<hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 26. <hi>Abbot de Strata Marc.</hi> and generally
the Rule is, <hi>Quod non praeſtat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimentum quod de jure non ſortitur
effectum.</hi> Vide fol. 381. <hi>b.</hi> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 80.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That conſtructions muſt be made of a Statute in
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion of the miſchief, and in advancement of the remedy, as by
this caſe it appeareth. For a Fine levied by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band onely, is within
the letter of the Law; but the miſchief was, the heir was barred of the
Inheritance of his Mother, by the warranty of his Father without Aſſets:
and this Act intended to apply a remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould not
barre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there were Aſſets, and therefore the miſchief is to be
ſuppreſſed, and the remedy advanced, <hi>Et qui haeret in littera, haeret

                  <p>As if there be Grandfather, and Son, and the Grandfather, and

And if in that caſe a ſtranger had brought a <hi>praecipe</hi> againſt

the Tenant, the warranty loſt not his force, but if the Tenant had judgement
to recover in value againſt the vouchee, he ſhould never vouch again by

nothing, but in the <hi>Cap. ad Val.</hi> it appeareth that he had Aſſets,
and he had been ſummoned before: But in ſome ſpeciall caſes, there
ſhall be two recoveries in value upon one warranty. As if a diſſeiſor
give lands to the husband and wife, and to the heirs of the husband: the
husband alieneth in fee with warranty and dieth, the wife bringeth a <hi>Cui in

                  <p>So it is where the wife bringing a Writ of Dower againſt the

                  <p>In the ſame manner it is if a man be ſeiſed of a rent by

impleaded for the <pb n="464" facs="tcp:33382:218"/> Land, he ſhall vouch, &amp;c. again
for the Land: But in theſe and the like caſes, the reaſon is in reſpect
